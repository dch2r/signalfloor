# signalfloor

Find out if a drop in your LLM eval scores is a real regression or just noise.

## The problem

You change a prompt, switch to a new model, or tweak your retriever. You rerun your evals and
accuracy goes from 82% to 80%. Did you break something?

Most eval tools show you the two numbers and leave the decision to you. But with a few hundred
test cases, a 2 point drop can easily happen by chance. So teams either ship real regressions
because they look small, or waste days chasing changes that were never there.

## What signalfloor does

signalfloor compares two eval runs and tells you if the difference is real.

- It compares the two runs case by case and gives you a confidence interval for the change,
  using a paired bootstrap.
- It measures how often your LLM judge agrees with human labels, so you know how far to trust
  its scores.
- It finds flaky test cases, the ones whose scores change between two identical runs.
- It reads OpenTelemetry traces, so you can use it alongside tools like Langfuse or Phoenix.
- It runs in CI and fails a pull request only when a regression is statistically real.
